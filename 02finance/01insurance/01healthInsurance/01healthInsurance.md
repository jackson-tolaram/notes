# Health Insurance Notes

## Things to consider when taking health insurance

1. Try and get a policy with no co-pay. Incase of copay you will have to pay a fixed percentage of your claim .
2. Try to have a policy with no room rent limits or higher room rent limits. Hospitals work in a package system where everything is tied up to your room rent. So if your room rent is higher every other cost doctor/surgeon will go up. Care usually tends to be better in rooms with higher rents. Most insurance thus will put a condition that they will pay only for a room which costs 1% of your total cover i.e if you have a cover of 1 lakh then they will pay only for a room till Rs 1000. So this becomes as important consideration
3. One more thing to understand is that health insurance premiums are not fixed and keep changing.
4. Dont get lured by free medical checkups as insurance companies then have access to your reports and they could increase your premium based on your reports
5. Cashless can be both good and bad. Good because you wont have to arrange for emergency funds. But bad because hospitals may keep you in longer and do unecessary tests if you are having a cashless insurance policy
6. Get a policy as high a possible initially and keep increasing the cover every year if possible.
7. Respore benifits are not so important as usually you will not have a totally different aiment in the claim period and the insurance company will connect new ailment to the older one in some manner.
8. Once you shorlist a few insurers read thier offer documents extremely carefully. Then only choose one.
9. If you already have an exisiting cover buy a super top up and not a top up.
10. You claim will increase based on age of individuals, risk profile of entire group, medical reports. Plan for atleast a 5% increase in same cover even if you do not increase it.
11. The insurance company will not pay for everything. So be ready for paying some costs. Your policy doucment will have a list of things the insurance company will not pay for.
12. Incase of very elperly parents try to keep them out of a family floater plan. Health insurance premiums are calculated on basis of the age of the oldest person and any preexixting illness incase of this person will further increase the premium.
13. Take care to declare all your medical history. Incase a medical insurance discovers something was not declared they can reject your claim

## Difference between a top up and super top up

Lets say in a year you had two hospitalizations of 4L and 3L and you have a preexisiting cover of 3L only. This is how this will be handled in:-

Super Top Up: You will get 1L for first hospitalization and 3L for the second one
Top Up: You will get only 1L for the first and nothing for the second as in case of super top up you need every hosptalization to be above your current insured amount(deductible). [Source](https://freefincal.com/after-buy-health-insurance-policy/)
